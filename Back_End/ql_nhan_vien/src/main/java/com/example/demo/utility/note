Exception Handling:

The handleException method is a simple utility to print the exception's message and stack trace to the console.
This can be useful for logging errors during development.

Export to Excel:

The exportToExcel method creates an Excel workbook using Apache POI.

It accepts a list of data (each String[] represents a row) and headers for the columns.

It creates the workbook and sheet, sets the header row, and fills in the data rows.

The method returns the created workbook.

Call Other API:

The callApi method uses RestTemplate to call an external API.

It takes the URL, HTTP method, payload, and headers as parameters.

It creates an HttpEntity with the payload and headers, then makes the API call using exchange method.

The method returns the response from the API as a ResponseEntity<String>.

Validation:

The validate method checks if there are validation errors in a BindingResult.

If errors are present, it collects the error messages for each field and joins them into a single string.

It returns this string of error messages, or null if there are no errors.
